    <!-- Here we're going to explore making things hidden and visible at different
     sizes. We add the extra class "hidden-xs" to the image. This means hidden at the
     extra small size. If we change it to "hidden-sm" then it's visible at the exta
     small size but it's not visible at the small size. It comes back for the medium
     and the large. It's hidden for that specific size and that specific size alone.
     If we want it hidden on extra small and small then we have to add both of the
     classes "hidden-xs" and "hidden-sm".

     We could also use the opposite which is "visible-sm". Where the element is
     only visible at that size. All other times it's invisible. visible only works
     for that particular size.
     
     It's worth pointing out that it doesn't mean that this image doesn't download
     on say a mobile that was extra small. Just because it's not there doesn't mean
     it hasn't downloaded. Because it's in our code it will download. So be careful
     if you are creating lots of big images, just because they aren't shown on the
     screen doesn't mean that your small mobile browser might not have them in
     memory because it will have them in memory. If your page become unresponsive
     or becomes slow that might be a reason why. You might have created lots of
     images for desktop that you are just hiding in a smaller browser. In that
     case you are still loading them, you are still using the same amount of
     bandwith and you're still holding it in memory. All that you're not doing
     is displaying it on the screen.
