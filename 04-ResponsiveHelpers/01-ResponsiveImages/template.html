    <!-- If we don't do anything to the images they are unresponsive. To fix this we
     can add the class "img-responsive" to images. That adds a responsive element on
     to this particluar image. Now we can see that our image is fitting inside of that
     column. It scales to fill as much of the column as it can up to the small breakpoint
     but it doesn't go over 100%. So it doesn't stretch over 100% but it remains so that it
     responds to the smaller sizes of the container. That's one of the responsive helpers
     that's available inside of Bootstrap enabling our media to scale to the right width
     of the column which it's placed in.
