        <!-- Whenever you see the word data, data-target, data-toggle. data is an element of
         HTML 5 that enables you to have specific functionality. Javascript is going to look
         for data-toggle, it's also going to look for data-target. So it knows that this is going
         to be the collapse element. This is the element that is going to be on screen on a small
         screen device only.

         The navbar-collapse is the actual class that's going to make it scroll out from underneath
         where it is. That's what we're kind of adding at this stage. It's nothing too much to
         worry about apart from the fact that it makes the navigation work on a small mobile
         device.
