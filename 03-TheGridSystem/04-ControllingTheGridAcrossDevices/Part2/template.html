    <!-- Here we have a different setup than before. We have 4 columns where we have
     used the class col-xs-6, but now we have also added col-md-3. What we are going
     to say here is that at the extra small size and the small size it's going to
     span 6 columns, but when we go up to the medium size breakpoint it's going to
     be 3. Anything above that it will be 3.

     As we have put col-md-3 in all of them we will end up with 4 columns in larger
     screens and 2 columns in smaller screens.

     Me: Even though there is only 1 row I think it wraps around if we put columns
     adding up to above 12 in a row.

    <!-- What may typically happen is that our columns should be different sizes as when
     we are designing things maybe be different sizes. When we go to the smaller sizes
     our design can really break up.
     
     We can't put column 1 inside a different row as then even at the large size we'll
     be over 2 particluar rows. Instead we need to add a div with the class "clearfix".
     However the clearfix will still apply at higher breakpoints so we need to add the
     classes "hidden-md" and "hidden-lg" which hides the clearfix at the medium breakpoint
     and the large breakpoint.

     The clearfix allows us to clear the gap.

     Me: put clearfix where things get messed up (below column 2).
