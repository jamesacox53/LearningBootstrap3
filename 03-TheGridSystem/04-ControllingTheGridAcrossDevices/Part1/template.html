    <!-- We're now going to take a look at controlling our grid across multiple
     devices. In other workds we are going to make our grid responsive. It always
     was responsive but we didn't examine it in the previous tutorial. For the columns
     we are going to examine what large (lg) does and then look at some of the other
     things we can put in it's place.

     We have our 2 large column setup, each of these are spanning 6 columns. If we resize
     this immediately at the first breakpoint it stops being 2 columns. That's what it's
     meant by those middle letters that we put in, col-lg. At the large screen as soon as
     we have gone past the large breakpoint (1200px) (anything greater than the large
     break point) it becomes 2 columns. But when the screen is smaller than the large
     breakpoint (less than 1200px) it remains 1 column (Me: it's on a separate row
     below).

     Now we try with col-md. md stands for medium. When starting at the maximum browser
     width and reducing when we go past the large breakpoint it stays as 2 columns.
     But when we get down to the medium breakpoint (992px) it changes to 2 full rows instead
     of 2 columns. Now the columns span the full width of the container.

     If we add another row with col-sm, sm stands for small. This time if we start from the
     biggest screen size and get smaller it will stay as 2 columns for above the large
     breakpoint (1200px). It will stay as 2 columns above the medium breakpoint (992px)
     and it will stay as 2 columns above the small breakpoint (768px). But it will become
     2 rows below the small breakpoint (768px), they are all 2 rows at below the small
     break point.

     There is another column size of xs, extra small. Extra small will always stay as 2
     columns regardless of how small the screen gets. Extra small never breaks down
     into rows.

     Me: think of it from the perspective of a small screen getting bigger. Everything
     will be 2 rows to start with. When we get above the small breakpoint (768px) then
     the small columns become columns. When we get above the medium breakpoint (992px)
     the medium columns will become columns. When we get above the large breakpoint (1200px)
     then the large columns will become columns. All other times the columns will be rows.
     But extra small always stays as the columns regardless of how small the screen gets.
