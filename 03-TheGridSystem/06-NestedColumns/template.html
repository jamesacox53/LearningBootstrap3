    <!-- In this tutorial we are going to take a look at nesting columns. That means
     we are going to create a column in our page and in that column we are going to add
     several other columns. Therefore the columns we add to the first column are going to
     be nested inside. To add columns inside another column we need to first create a row
     in that column.

     Our nested column is 6 divisions wide and sits in a column that's 9 wide so you might
     think we have to have another column that's 3 divisions wide but we don't. When we
     nest columns they must add up to 12. Anytime we put columns inside of other columns
     they must always add up to 12 because that is the grid. It's based on percentages
     rather than anything else.
