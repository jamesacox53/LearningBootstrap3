      <!-- There's no need to put each of the rows in separate containers. The only
       reason we would ever want to do that is if we wanted to have different coloured
       backgrounds within those containers. Then we would have to put them in separate
       containers. In this case the purpose of the row is really to clear the row above
       it. This will become more important when we start to put columns in the rows.
       We now have 2 rows and they are clearing each other, that's the main part of what
       the row is to do. When we put columns inside of these rows they will always
       clear eachother and no matter what happens they will be pushed down to clear
       the row above. -->
