      <!-- A well in Bootstrap is just a grey box. Anything we put inside a well
       div just gives us a grey box. This will expand to fit the full width of the
       container.
       
       The container automatically centers any content in the browser. We use those
       regularly. The container is used to center things and that's the main part
       about the grid, in this case is that the container centers it inside of that
       grid. The container is set to be at certain breakpoints. So at fullscreen
       it's set for a browser with a width of 1200px, it also breaks at 992px,
       at 768px and below that it fills the full width with just a little padding
       at the side.
