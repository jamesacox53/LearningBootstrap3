    <!-- In this tutorial we are going to look at changing the layout depending on the
     size. It may be that at different sizes we want to re-order our content. Maybe we want
     to have one of the columns that are displayed before another one at a small screen
     placed after it in a large screen. Let's take a look at how we would do that. We
     want to swap the order of Column 1 and Column 2 if we're above a specific point
     in our browser.

     You have to remember that bootstrap is always designed for the smallest size first and
     then other sizes afterwards. So this is designed specifically for mobile now even though
     we are looking at it on a much larger screen. Now we are going to re-order it based on
     if we are looking at it on a larger screen. We add the class col-md-push-6 to the first
     column. This class says at the medium breakpoint we are going to push this column over
     6. Very similar to that in the second one we are going to add the class col-md-pull-6
     which says to pull it over 6. At the larger screen size Column 2 is now ordered before
     column 1. At smaller screen sizes Column 1 appears before Column 2.

     Using the push and pull structure we can decide exactly which column gets displayed
     where based upon it's screen size. This is extremely useful as we go about creating
     our complex design structure.

        <div class="col-md-6 col-md-push-6">
          <div class="well">Column 1</div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 col-md-pull-6">
          <div class="well">Column 2</div>
        </div>
