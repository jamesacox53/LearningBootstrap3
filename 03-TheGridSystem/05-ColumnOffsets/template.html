    <!-- Lets say that we wanted to create a more complicated layout where we want 2
     columns but with a gap inbetween. Here we would need to have 2 columns that span
     4 of Bootstraps columns and then a gap. We need to learn how to offset the second
     column. To offset a column we need to add the class col-md-offset-4. This means
     that at the medium and above breakpoint the column is offset by 4. This still
     adds up to 12 so it should still fill our columns. But we don't have to make
     the offset add up to 12, if we leave some out then it just leaves some space at
     the end.
