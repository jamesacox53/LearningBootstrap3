    <!-- We have examined containers and we have examined rows. The next element to
     examine in our grid setup is looking at the columns. The columns enable us to
     have a grid structure because they enable us to have different sized columns
     across our screen.
     
     For the column class it starts with col- and then we have to state the size
     of the column. We'll look at these in more detail in a later tutorial. Here
     lets go with large (lg). Once it's in place we need to say how many columns
     this intends to span. The column setup inside bootstrap is 12 columns. That's
     the total amount of columns that we have to add our columns up to. If we go
     with 6 it will take half the amount of columns. If we have 2 columns that had
     6 that would span the full 12 columns.

     We can use the columns to build complex layouts.
